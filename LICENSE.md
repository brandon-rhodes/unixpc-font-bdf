Please note that the following license applies *only* to the files
`README.md`, `NEED_BDFLIB`, `convert.py`, and `requirements.txt` that
Brandon Rhodes personally authored.

The `system.8.ft` binary file in this repository, by contrast, is
extracted from a retroware archive of the old UNIX PC software, and
provided here only for fair-use personal or academic study of the art of
traditional bitmap computer fonts.  I have no license to distribute the
font under more permissive terms.

Since `unixpc-system.8.bdf` is a derived work from the original font, we
must presume that it labors under the same restrictions.
